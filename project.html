        <h4>
            The Game "In Atmosphere" is a game idea that started development in 2019,
         and only started back up on serious development recently and is currently being built on Unreal engine 5.
         <p>
            The premise of the game is two factions, possibly three fight on the inside
            of what can only be described as a dyson sphere, using combined arms tactics,
            leveraging ground, air, and naval assets. 
         </p>
         <p>
            The dyson sphere itself is an enigma, in its very center not hosting a star
             or sun as we would know it, but an inverted black hole "white hole", with factions
             involved fighting over controll of the stellar megastucture specifically to harness 
             the potential of the anomoly within. 
         </p>
